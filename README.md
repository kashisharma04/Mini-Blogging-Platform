# Mini-Blogging-Platform
Welcome to the Simple Blogging Platform RESTful API project! 

## Project Overview
The Simple Blogging Platform RESTful API is a backend solution designed to power a basic yet functional blogging platform. This project showcases our ability to create a secure and efficient RESTful API, incorporating essential features for user registration, authentication, blog post management, and commenting.

## Technologies
1. Node.js and Express.js for building the API.
2. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.
3. MONGODB for data storage.

## Key Features:

1. User Registration and Authentication: Users can easily register and log in using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication.

2. Blog Post Management (CRUD Operations): Logged-in users have full control over their blog posts, with the ability to create, read, update, and delete their own content. Additionally, users can explore and read posts authored by others.

3. Commenting Feature: Users can actively engage with the community by leaving comments on both their posts and those of others. They can also edit or remove their own comments.

4. Relational Database: All data is efficiently managed and stored in a relational database system, providing reliability and scalability.
